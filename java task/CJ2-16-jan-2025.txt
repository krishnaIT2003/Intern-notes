JAVA OPERATORS:
   
       Arithematic operators : +,-,*,/,%
       Relational operators: ==,<=,>=,!=,<,>
       Logical operators:  &&, ||, !
       BitWise Operator:  &, | ,^, ~,<<,>>,>>>
       Assignment Operator:  =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=
       unary operators: ++,--
(postincrement: the value is used then incremented or decreased    pre increment: the value is incremented or decreased and then it is used)

       Ternary Operator:  ?:  (used to check for conditional , a shorthand for if else ) 



    IF ELSE :

     he if-else statement in Java is used for decision-making based on conditions. the condition evalutes based on true or false
 
        if else:
              if(){}
              else{}

       if else ladder:
               if(){}
               else if(){}
               else if(){}
               else{}

      nested if else:
                 if(){ if(){} else{} }
                 else { if(){} else{}}
    
      Ternary Operator:    shorthand of if else
                 ex: String valid=age>18? "accept":"reject";




    Switch Statement:
       The switch statement in Java is a control flow statement that is used to execute one block of code out of many options based on the value of an expression.
       It's an alternative to using multiple if-else-if statements, offering cleaner and more readable code.



       Expression Type: The switch expression must evaluate to one of the following types:
         byte, short, char, int (primitive types)
          String (introduced in Java 7)
           enum types
           Case Values: Each case must have a unique constant value (no variables or ranges).
         Break Statement: The break statement is used to exit the switch block. Without it, execution "falls through" to the next case.
         Default Case: The default block is optional and is executed if no other case matches.
