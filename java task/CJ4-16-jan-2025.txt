OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING:
            oop is a paradigm where it provides a structure and systematic approach to solve real time problems by modeling them using objects and classes .


      .Encapsulation:   
            Wrapping Data and methods together into a single unit ,typically a class .
            achieved by using access modifiers and making the fields private and creating getters and setters and providing the access 
      .Inheritance
             Allows a class (subclass) to inherit fields and methods from another class (superclass).
              Achieved using the extends keyword.
              Promotes code reusability. 
      .Polymorphism
             Allows objects to take on many forms:
            Compile-time Polymorphism: Achieved via method overloading.
             Run-time Polymorphism: Achieved via method overriding.


       .Abstraction

              Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential features.
                 Achieved using:
          Abstract classes (abstract keyword).
             Interfaces


            Classes and Objects

                A class is a blueprint for objects, defining their properties and behaviors.
                An object is an instance of a class.

     
        Constructor:
               constructor is a special method to initialize an object 
                  it has the same name as  the class name with no return type.
                   the constructor is called automatically when an object is created
          
             Types of constructor:
                       default constructor
                       parameterized constructor
                       copy constructor


        

        STATIC KEYWORD :


          static keywords in java is used to indicate that a member belongs to the class rather than to any specific instances of the class
         the static members shared to all the objects of the class 

              where we can declare static keyword:
                   Static variables
                   static methods 
                   static blocks
                   static class (only for nested class we can declare a static keyword )

    
         static keyword is initalized only once and not with object creation
        Typically used for constants


     static block:
          a static block is used to initatilize static variables 
          it is excecuted only once ,when the class is loaded into memory, before any object is created or an static method is called 


             Note: static methods are overloaded in java but static methods cannot be overrided because they are bound to class rather than instance
                      . if we try to override then it will be method hiding   (it hides the child class and the parent will be invoked even we create child object)







     INHERITANCE :
      
          inheritance in java allows one class (child class) to acquire the properties of another class (parent class) 


           Types Of Inheritance:
                  Single Inheritance 
                  Multilevel Inheritance
                  Hierarchical Inheritance 
                  Multiple Inheritance (Through interface only)
                  Hybrid Inheritance (Hierarchical + multiple)








           ASSOCIATION:
               
            Association in java defines the connection between two classes that are set up through objects .
                 Association manages one-to-one ,one-to-many,many-to-one, many-to-many relationships
