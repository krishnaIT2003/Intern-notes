 EXCEPTION HANDLING:
  
             Exception Handling in Java is a powerful mechanism to handle runtime errors, allowing the normal flow of the program to be maintained. It helps to manage unexpected 
              conditions that arise during the execution of the program, such as input errors, file handling issues, or network problems.

               Java uses try-catch blocks to handle exceptions, and it follows a specific hierarchy and flow for dealing with errors.


           Exception:

               An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s execution.
                  Exceptions can be either checked or unchecked.
             
             Error:

              Errors are serious problems that a program cannot typically recover from (e.g., OutOfMemoryError).
               Errors are not handled by the program using exception handling.

 
         Types of Exceptions:

                Checked exceptions: Exceptions that must be either caught or declared to be thrown. (e.g., IOException, SQLException)
                Unchecked exceptions: Subclasses of RuntimeException. These exceptions do not need to be explicitly handled. (e.g., NullPointerException, ArithmeticException)


               Throwable is the parent class of all errors and exceptions.


              Handling Excetions in Java:
  
                        try-catch Block
                            A try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. If an exception occurs, it is caught by a catch block.

                               finally Block
                             The finally block is used to execute important code, such as resource cleanup, whether an exception is thrown or not. It is optional but useful when you need
                              to ensure that certain code runs.



                          The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception. You can throw both checked and unchecked exceptions.
                                          throw new ExceptionType("Message");


             throws Keyword
         The throws keyword is used in a method signature to indicate that a method can throw exceptions. This is used for checked exceptions that the calling method must handle.
                   public void method() throws ExceptionType {
    // Code that may throw an exception
                     }
