Coding Stadards:

   Coding standards are the rules , guidelines and best practices which help to build standard and strcutred program 
   The standards can be naming convention, indentation, commenting ,structure and organization.
   the main reason to keep a code in a standard and structure way to reduce the errors and promote consistency and make code easier to read and maintain

    Coding standards are important because :
       .to make developers to easy to read and understand
       .to maintain the strcuture of the code and the task easily
       .to prevent the confusion when there is a collaboration and multiple developers work on same project(so we follow the standard naming conventions and best practies)
       .error reduction
       .clear standards improve productivity

    lets start the standards implementation :
     
      1, Naming Conventions: naming convetions are the rules that specify how to name the variables ,functions,classes and other identifiers in the code.   
                     camelCase: for vairables and functions (ex : userAccount(), userId)
                      PascalCase: pascalcase is used for class or  types (ex : EmployeeAccount)

                        snake_case: snake_case is used in mostly python and ruby 


      2, Indentation and Formatting: proper indentation 












Sonarlint:
    sonarlint is  a real time code quality and static analysis tool that help developers catch bugs ,security vulnerabilities,and other issues before even they commit

it gives feedback and helps to spot issues

sonar lint works by analyzing your code and compare it to a set of rules based on best practices, coding standards and know issues
