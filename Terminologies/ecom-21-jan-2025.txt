DROP SHIP VENDOR (DSV):

  A drop shipping model, where the retailer (eCommerce store) 
   does not keep inventory in stock. Instead, when an order is placed, the retailer sends the order directly to a third-party vendor (drop shipper) who fulfills and ships the product directly to the customer.

    The retailer handles the sales process, customer service, and marketing, while the vendor manages inventory and shipping.


Note: In DSV, the retailer doesn't hold the product in stock. Instead, the vendor (like Puma) ships directly to the customer after receiving the order.

    Example:
   In this case, here's how the process would work in a Drop Ship Vendor (DSV) model:

            Customer purchases a Puma product on Amazon's eCommerce platform.
         Amazon (the retailer) processes the order and receives payment.
           Instead of Amazon having the product in its own warehouse, Amazon will notify Puma (the vendor) to fulfill the order.
         Puma (the vendor) will then pick the product from its warehouse and ship it directly to the customer.
           Amazon does not handle the shipping; Puma is responsible for shipping the product directly to the customer's destination.
         
  In this model:
          Puma handles the inventory and shipping directly to the customer.
         Amazon acts as the marketplace platform where the transaction takes place but does not hold the product in its own warehouse.





DISTRIBUTION CENTER ORDERS (DC):
  
    A distribution center is a facility where inventory is stored, sorted, and shipped from. In the DC order model, eCommerce stores fulfill orders from their own warehouses or distribution centers.
      The retailer or company directly manages inventory and logistics, and orders are shipped from the DC to the customer.
    DC orders offer more control over inventory management and fulfillment but require maintaining and managing a physical distribution center.


In DC, the retailer (like Amazon) holds the inventory in its own warehouse and is responsible for picking, packing, and shipping the product to the customer.

In the DC (Distribution Center) model, the process works a bit differently, with more control over the entire supply chain. Here's how it typically works:

Customer purchases a Puma product on Amazon's eCommerce platform (or any other retailer's platform).

Amazon (the retailer) has the Puma product already in its own warehouse (distribution center) or fulfillment center, or it could be stored at a third-party warehouse Amazon operates.

Amazon picks the product from its warehouse (DC) and ships it directly to the customer.

In this model, Amazon is responsible for both holding inventory and fulfilling the order. The products are stocked and managed by Amazon, which then fulfills the orders when customers make a purchase.
